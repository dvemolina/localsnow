		"faq": {
			"title": "Common Questions",
			"deposit_q": "Why the 15€ deposit for clients?",
			"deposit_a": "It prevents spam and fake requests. The deposit is fully refundable after your confirmed lesson with the instructor. Each booking request requires a deposit, which protects instructors from no-shows and ensures serious inquiries.",
			"lead_fee_q": "Why the 5€ lead fee for instructors?",
			"lead_fee_a": "It covers server costs, email notifications, and platform maintenance. Unlike booking platforms that take 15-20% commissions, we only charge for the initial connection - not the lessons themselves.",
			"payments_q": "How do payments work?",
			"payments_a": "Clients pay instructors directly for lessons - we're not involved. The only payments processed through our platform are the client deposit (refundable) and instructor lead fees (5€ per request). Both are handled securely through Stripe.",
			"no_response_q": "What if an instructor doesn't respond?",
			"no_response_a": "Try another instructor. Instructors aren't obligated to respond to every request - they might be fully booked or unavailable for your dates. Your 15€ deposit remains valid for future requests.",
			"contact_q": "Can instructors see my contact info before paying?",
			"contact_a": "No. Instructors see your dates, skill level, and requirements, but contact information is hidden until they pay the 5€ lead fee. This protects both parties from spam."
